        <p>I come from Georgia. I studied at BYU and wish to complete my degree on the side.
            In high school I picked up musical theatre and learned a little guitar. Throughout 
            my life, I have developed a passion for learning languages. Particularly Russian and 
            Spanish which I used during my two years of community service.
            <br><br>
            Becoming a web developer makes a lot of sense for me, as I enjoy the activity and I have 
            learned that often experience and skill speaks louder than degrees. So I went to DevMountain
            to jumpstart my career. Currently I go to school at BYU(I took the semester off for DevMountain)
            I only plan to take 3-6 credits a semester, that way I can focus on work.
